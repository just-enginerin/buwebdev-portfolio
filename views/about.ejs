            <p>Hi again! If you're curious to know more about me, I'm a twenty-six year old living her best life in New York City.</p>
                
            <p>I am currently an Applications Developer specializing in Front End web development on Marsh McLennan's Corporate Information Solutions (CIS) Innovation team. I work to develop and optimize the design and usability of Global Finance Enterprise applications as part of an integral initiative to modernize and automate cumbersome financial processes. Additionally, I am studying Web Development at Bellevue University's accelerated online Bachelor's degree program.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I prefer to disconnect from screens by hiking through New York and New Jersey's parks and trailways. I enjoy wandering through the woods either by myself, with my partner or as a member of a local hiking group for women of color. On my hikes I'll usually be birdwatching, foraging, and sometimes climbing! When I'm not immersed in nature, I love exploring the city's many museums, art galleries, libraries, vintage shops, and family-owned restaurants. At home, I like to read, cook, and play video games on my PC or PS4.</p>
